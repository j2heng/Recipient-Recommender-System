## 1. Data
The original dataset is Enron Email corpus, a real large-scale corporate email collection. It contains approximately 500,000 emails generated by employees of the Enron Corporation.

This project uses only a subset of the original dataset (approximately 50,000). 

## 2. Problem description
Given the user's email history, the goal is to develop a system which recommends a list of 10 recipients for a new email message, ranked by decreasing order of relevance. More precisely, we consider a user u who has, until some point in time t, sent and received emails. Now, given a new email message m that u composes at time t, we would like to predict the recipient(s) to whom u intends to send this specific email. 

The implemented approach is largely inspired by this paper **_Vitor R. Carvalho and William Cohen. Recommending recipients in the Enron email corpus._** 

The problem can be defined as a large multi-class multi-label classification task

## 3. Methods
Classification-based reranking algorithms which combine two types of features: 
- textual contents: tfidf + knn (based-on cosine similarity)
- network information
  - frequency features
  - recency features
  - likeness feature from the email headers
